# TicTacToe

This project uses Javascript, HTML, and CSS in order to make an interative Tic Tac Toe game. The website is fully responsive on all devices. The user is provided with a grid to play the game on and provided with instructions on whether it's the "X" or the "O" that needs to go. Additionally, if the user runs into any errors, they can simply reset and bring a new grid to their screens.
